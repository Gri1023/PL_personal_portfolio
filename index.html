                    <p>Hi! My full name is Hryhorii Bavykin, but everybody calls me Grisha. Right now I am studying at European Studies 4 year programme at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. My favourite subject is Political Challenges, since I really like history, geography and modern politics. In my free time, I like to code (for ex. this website or my computer game), go for a walk or write something about politics or other topics for my <a href="https://t.me/grycko_the_hague_couloir">personal Telegram chanell</a>, where I also use my photo and video-editing skills, which are still pretty basic, but not too bad. You can navigate through my oesonal digital portfolio website trough buttons above in the header. Also, there is zoom for every picture that you will see, so just ckick on it to make it larger. This website was written by me on basic HTML and CSS codes and it hosted on GitHub Pages. If you are interested how it looks inside, you can exlore it <a href="https://github.com/Gri1023/PL_personal_portfolio">my GitHub repository</a></p>

            <h3>General reflection semester 1</h3>
            <p>I made some noticeable progress thought his semester. Personal Leadership helped me to state for myself what are my key values and goals and determine what I need to do to fully achieve them. The first thing I am most proud of is that I am very motivated, or specifically energetic . I have been very active during all my classes, especially Political Challenges. The decision to become a class representative was also an important step to play active role in my class social life. I am happy that I helped some people with their problems and teachers to efficiently communicate with class. I consider that I fully achieved this goal and if you ask anyone in the class about who was the most active at almost any time, that would be me. Second goal that I partially achieved, but I am still in a progress, is an attitude to be organized, which is very important, especially if there are a lot of tasks that no one except of yourself can force or motivate you to do. I think that I did not fully achieve it because I still find it hard to stand up fro the bed and do something, which results in me starting to work 10 or 20 minus later than planned initially. Even setting a timer does not always help. That is why I usually use my big break between 12 and 15:30 on Monday to sit and work in the THUAS library, where I have way less things that distract me and I feel more focused. Overall, I became way more organised and active closer to the end of the semester, while at the start they were kind of missing.</p>

            <h3>Individual reflection of evaluation groupwork</h3>
            <p>Overall, there were two key factors that influenced the complete success of our group. The first one, which was obvious for us even before we did most of the work based on our Starfish method column with "Keep" text is how we <u style="text-decoration: underline;">divide our work</u>. Each seminar or meeting we clearly divided between who does what, when, and who can help. Another thing was the level of <u style="text-decoration: underline;">responsibility</u> each team member had. Everyone did what was expected from him, with no delays or other problems. This essential easiness of work played a main role in our success. We never experienced the situation that someone covers someone else and does his work, or that without help the person can't complete his part. This made the process, easy, fast, and efficient. Moving to my own performance, I think that I positively affected our teamwork level. Firstly, I am the one who proposed to meet for the first time outside of seminars, so I essentially started the performance part of the process. And when we met, I was the only one who completed my work beforehand, so I stimulated others to finish that part on Tuesday, so we have Wednesday left to finish all details and make a poster. Now, analysing the feedback I received from my teammates, I found a lot of similarities. First, and the most obvious one was the thing about me being distracted by Tetris, which no one liked of course. But there were positive sides too, I am happy that others agree that I did my part great using graphs created in Excel and presented it well. Also, Sid admitted that I knew my topic great, as well as being aware of what others are doing. Except playing Tetris and my ability to focus, I did not receive any suggestions, but I will consider turning on focus mode on both my laptop and phone next time so I won't receive notifications and thus be less distracted.</p>

            <p>1. Enhancing Seminar Participation and Time Management Goal (connected with being pitfall Burnout or Overexertion: </p>
